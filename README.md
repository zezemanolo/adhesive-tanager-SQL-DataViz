# BJ and ZEZE do some SQL + Data Visualization

##Our goal is to achieve project completion by fulfilling the three specs provided in the issue below: 1) Complete SQL Tutorials, 2) create a database (and a table to work with), and 3) build an app that displays data queries

## Using express to connect to local server, pg module to "read" the database data (postgresql), and may need pg-promise + pug down the road

## Description

#### 1. Complete any combination of these SQL tutorials:
(a) The [Database Foundations course on Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/database-foundations) OR
(b) the [Learn SQL track on Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/learn-sql) which includes four courses "SQL Basics," "Modifying Data with SQL,"  "Reporting with SQL," and "Querying Relational Databases."  OR
(c) [SQLZoo Tutorials]( http://sqlzoo.net/)

#### 2. Build a SQL database and an app that displays queries to this database to the front end/browser.

#### 3. (Optional) When you're done with that, explore data visualization options like [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/) or [D3](https://d3js.org/) and use one of these technologies to visualize your data on the front end.


## Context
#### For Newbie and Intermediate Learners
This goal gives you the opportunity to learn how to set up a database on back end server, hook it up to a front end/browser, and render your data to the browser.( It is a first step towards learning how to set up CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) for a database, as it asks only for implementation of "Read" functionality.) You will also learn how to use [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/about/), mySQL, or a similar database management system (DBMS)

Prior to starting this goal, learners should be familiar with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), setting up node_modules and dependencies with[ npm (Node Package Manager)](https://www.npmjs.com/), setting up a server (i.e., using [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and/or Express Generator), and other server side technologies like templating view engines (i.e., [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) or [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)).

Treehouse does have three tutorials that will bring you up to speed: [Node.js Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/nodejs-basics), [NPM Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/npm-basics), and [Express Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/express-basics) (includes explanation of pug templating).

#### For Advanced Learners
More advanced learners wishing to work with REACT may build this using REACT, MongoDB for their database, and use  [D3](https://d3js.org/) for their data visualization. These learners may wish to refer to FreeCodeCamp's forthcoming unit on ["Data Visualization"](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map).

### Happy databasing!



## Specifications

- [ ] Complete Database Foundations; or the SQL Basic track (includes SQL Basics, Modifying Data with SQL. Reporting with SQL, and Querying Relational Databases) on Treehouse; and/or the [SQL Zoo Tutorial]( http://sqlzoo.net/).
- [ ] Create a SQL database and import into it a public set of data (Google public fun data sets as in [this article](http://rs.io/100-interesting-data-sets-for-statistics/)), or create your own data set /
- [ ] Build an app that displays data queries from your newly created database!

## Stretch Goals

- [ ] Render your data using a data visualization tool like  [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/) or D3.
- [ ] Use and public API to retrieve a data set to manipulate using [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/). You can search for a public [API using Programable Web's Directory](http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory), or work with Government data from [https://www.data.gov/developers/apis](https://www.data.gov/developers/apis).
